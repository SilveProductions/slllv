<h3>///FAQ</h3>


<h1>Who are you and what are you doing?</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm SLLLV. I'm a character artist, illustrator and game designer. I'm currently working on SunCity lore.</p>



<h1>SunCity?</h1>
<p>SunCity is a fictional city where all of my original characters and events take place. I plan to expand this universe more and more with time.</p>

<h1>What does SLLLV mean?</h1>
<p> I used to like silver (the color) so I made up the acronym SLVR. It was pretty obvious and meaningless, so I removed the final letter and multiplied that L, that seemed pretty lonely to me.</p>

<h1>Commissions?</h1>
<p>Commissions are always open. Feel free to submit any interesting project you have along with your available budget.
If your commission has been accepted, I will reach back to you.</p>


<h1>Can I use your art? Can I draw your characters?</h1>
<p>I'm okay with anything that doesn't involve claiming my art as your own or monetizing my work. Using the hashtag "#slllv" to credit me is greatly appreciated. I am free to make sure I don't get associated with works that depicts values I do not resonate with.</p>
